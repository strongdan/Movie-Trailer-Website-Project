This is a website that utilizes Python classes to dynamically populate pages with movie content, including title, poster art and a trailer link

##Functionality

* Content - Page presents all required content (movie title, poster art, and trailer link)
* Python Data Structure - Page is dynamically generated from a Python data structure
* Errors - Page is free of errors, glitches, and bugs

##Code Review

###Use of Variables:

* Code uses variables to avoid magic numbers
* Each variable name reflects the purpose of the value stored in it
* Once initiated, the purpose of each variable is maintained throughout the program
* No variables override Python built-in values (for example, def)

###Use of Functions:

* Functions are used as tools to automate tasks which are likely to be repeated
* Functions produce the appropriate output (typically with a return statement) from the appropriate input (function parameters)
* No functions are longer than 18 lines of code (does not include blank lines, comments, or function and variable definitions)

###Appropriate Use of Data
* The appropriate data types are used consistently (strings for text, lists for ordered data, nested lists as appropriate)

###Appropriate Use of Coding Techniques

* Student demonstrates coding techniques like branching and loops appropriately (i.e. to loop through a list, for element in list:; or to test whether something is in a list, if name in list_names:)

###Appropriate Use of Classes

* Code defines classes properly and uses instances of those classes in the code

###Comments / Documentation

* Each function includes a comment which explains the intended behavior, inputs, and outputs (if applicable)
